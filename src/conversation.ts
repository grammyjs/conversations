     * session access, file downloads, requests to external APIs, randomness,
     * time-based functions, and more. **It requires any data obtained from the
     * outside to be serializable.**
     *
     * Remember that a conversation function is not executed like a normal
     * JavaScript function. Instead, it is often interrupted and replayed,
     * sometimes many times for the same update. If this is not obvious to you,
     * it means that you probably should read [the documentation of this
     * plugin](https://grammy.dev/plugins/conversations) in order to avoid
     * common pitfalls.
     *
     * For instance, if you want to access to your database, you only want to
     * read or write data once, rather than doing it once per replay. `external`
     * provides an escape hatch to this situation. You can wrap your database
     * call inside `external` to mark it as something that performs
     * side-effects. The replay engine inside the conversations plugin will then
     * make sure to only execute this operation once. This looks as follows.
     *
     * ```ts
     * // Read from database
     * const data = await conversation.external(async () => {
     *   return await readFromDatabase()
     * })
     *
     * // Write to database
     * await conversation.external(async () => {
     *   await writeToDatabase(data)
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * When `external` is called, it returns whichever data the given callback
     * function returns. Note that this data has to be persisted by the plugin,
     * so you have to make sure that it can be serialized. The data will be
     * stored in the storage backend you provided when installing the
     * conversations plugin via `bot.use`. In particular, it does not work well
     * to return objects created by an ORM, as these objects have functions
     * installed on them which will be lost during serialization.
     *
     * As a rule of thumb, imagine that all data from `external` is passed
     * through `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))` (even though this is not what
     * actually happens under the hood).
     *
     * The callback function passed to `external` receives the outside context
     * object from the current middleware pass. This lets you access properties
     * on the context object that are only present in the outside middleware
     * system, but that have not been installed on the context objects inside a
     * conversation. For example, you can access your session data this way.
     *
     * ```ts
     * // Read from session
     * const data = await conversation.external((ctx) => {
     *   return ctx.session.data
     * })
     *
     * // Write to session
     * await conversation.external((ctx) => {
     *   ctx.session.data = data
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * Note that while a call to `external` is running, you cannot do any of the
     * following things.
     *
     * - start a concurrent call to `external` from the same conversation
     * - start a nested call to `external` from the same conversation
     * - start a Bot API call from the same conversation
     *
     * Naturally, it is possible to have several concurrent calls to `externals`
     * if they happen in unrelated chats. This still means that you should keep
     * the code inside `external` to a minimum and actually only perform the
     * desired side-effect itself.
     *
     * If you want to return data from `external` that cannot be serialized, you
     * can specify a custom serialization function. This allows you choose a
     * different intermediate data representation during storage than what is
     * present at runtime.
     *
     * ```ts
     * // Read bigint from an API but persist it as a string
     * const largeNumber: bigint = await conversation.external({
     *   task: () => fetchCoolBigIntFromTheInternet(),
     *   beforeStore: (largeNumber) => String(largeNumber),
     *   afterLoad: (str) => BigInt(str),
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * Note how we read a bigint from the internet, but we convert it to string
     * during persistence. This now allows us to use a storage adapter that only
     * handles strings but does not need to support the bigint type.

     * A namespace full of various utitilies for building forms.
     *
     * Typically, `wait` calls return context objects. Optionally, these context
     * objects can be accepted or rejected based on validation, such as with
     * `waitFor` which only returns context objects matching a given filter
     * query.
     *
     * Forms add another level of convenience on top of this. They no longer
     * require you to deal with context objects. Each form field performs both
     * validation and selection. This means that it picks out certain property
     * from the context object—such as the message text—and returns this
     * property directly.
     *
     * As an example, here is how you can wait for a number using the form field
     * `.number`.
     *
     * ```ts
     * // Wait for a number
     * const n = await conversation.form.number()
     * // Send back its square
     * await ctx.reply(`The square of ${n} is ${n * n}!`)
     * ```
     *
     * There are many more form fields that let you wait for virtually any type
     * of message content.
     *
     * All form fields give you the option to perform an action if the
     * validation fails by accepting an `otherwise` function. This is similar to
     * filtered wait calls.
     *
     * ```ts
     * const text = await conversation.form.select(["Yes", "No"], {
     *   otherwise: ctx => ctx.reply("Please send Yes or No.")
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * In addition, all form fields give you the option to perform some action
     * when a value is accepted. For example, this is how you can delete
     * incoming messages.
     *
     * ```ts
     * const text = await conversation.form.select(["Yes", "No"], {
     *   action: ctx => ctx.deleteMessage()
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * Note that either `otherwise` or `action` will be called, but never both
     * for the same update.
