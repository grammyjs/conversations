/**
 * Middleware for the conversations plugin.
 *
 * This is the main thing you have to install in order to use this plugin. It
 * performs various setup tasks for each context object, and it reads and writes
 * to the data storage if provided. This middleware has to be installed before
 * you can install `createConversation` with your conversation builder function.
 *
 * You can pass {@link ConversationOptions | an options object} to the plugin.
 * The most important option is called `storage`. It can be used to persist
 * conversations durably in any storage backend of your choice. That way, the
 * conversations can survive restarts of your server.
 *
 * ```ts
 * conversations({
 *   storage: {
 *     type: "key",
 *     version: 0, // change the version when you change your code
 *     adapter: new FileAdapter("/home/bot/data"),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A list of known storage adapters can be found
 * [here](https://github.com/grammyjs/storages/tree/main/packages#grammy-storages).
 *
 * It is advisable to version your data when you persist it. Every time you
 * change your conversation function, you can increment the version. That way,
 * the conversations plugin can make sure to avoid any data corruption caused by
 * mismatches between state and implementation.
 *
 * Note that the plugin takes two different type parameters. The first type
 * parameter should corresopnd with the context type of the outside middleware
 * tree. The second type parameter should correspond with the custom context
 * type used inside all conversations. If you may want to use different context
 * types for different conversations, you can simply use `Context` here, and
 * adjust the type for each conversation individually.
 *
 * Be sure to read [the documentation about the conversations
 * plugin](https://grammy.dev/plugins/conversations) to learn more about how to
 * use it.
 *
 * @param options Optional options for the conversations plugin
 * @typeParam OC Custom context type of the outside middleware
 * @typeParam C Custom context type used inside conversations

     * An array of plugins to be installed on every context object created by

     *
     * Remember that when a conversation is executed, it creates a number of
     * context objects from scratch during each replay. If this is not obvious
     * to you, it means that you probably should read [the documentation of this
     * plugin](https://grammy.dev/plugins/conversations) in order to avoid
     * common pitfalls.
     *
     * The created context objects did not pass through the middleware tree, so
     * they will not have any properties installed on them. You can use this
     * configuration option to specify a number of grammY plugins that should
     * receive each context object created by the conversation.
     *
     * This lets you use many plugins inside the conversation. However, there
     * are still a few things to be aware of. In a typical middleware pass,
     * every plugin can process a context object, then call `next` to wait for
     * downstream middleware to finish, and then get the opportunity to perform
     * cleanup tasks or execute other code after the update was processed
     * downstream.
     *
     * Passing middleware to the `plugins` array will behave differently in the
     * sense that a call to `next` will resolve immediately. The context object
     * is given to the conversation only after all plugins have processed it.
     * Plugins that depend on executing tasks after calling `next` therefore
     * will not work correctly.
     *
     * If a plugin decides to fully handle an update by not calling `next`, then
     * this will consume the update. Any pending `wait` calls inside the
     * conversation will only receive the next incoming update.
     *
     * Note that you can install Bot API transformers from inside middleware,
     * too. This lets you modify the instances of `Api` created by the
     * conversations plugin.
     *
     * ```ts
     * plugins: [async (ctx, next) => {
     *   ctx.api.config.use(transformer)
     *   await next()
     * }]
     * ```
     *
     * In some cases, TypeScript is known not to be able to infer the correct
     * context type for plugins passed to this configuration option. The types
     * are still checked, though, which leads to compilation errors. They can be
     * fixed by passing the custom context type to the plugins explicitly. Note
     * that you need to use the custom context type used inside the
     * conversation, not the custom context type used in the outside middleware.

     * the second conversation will receive the update. This order is determined

     * middleware tree. If multiple conversations with the same identifer are
     * active, they will recieve the update in chronological order of the time
     * that the conversations were entered.

     * middleware might process the update.
